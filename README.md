# DNTK (DNToolKit)
This is the C# backend for DNTK

# Protos
We get our proto definitions and packet opcodes from [Sorapointa Protos](https://github.com/Sorapointa/Sorapointa-Protos)

# RSAKey
You need to bring your own RSA Key, extracted from the client, if the one in this repo does not work.


# TODO
- also make sure to remove every field definition from gettokenreq and playerlogin that pertains to user data
- public build - scuffed protos
- private build - for full iridium
- SetFilterNotify
