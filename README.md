# RSAKey
You need to bring your own RSA Key, extracted from the client, if the one in this repo does not work.


# TODO
- also make sure to remove every field definition from gettokenreq and playerlogin that pertains to user data
- public build - scuffed protos
- private build - for full iridium
- SetFilterNotify

# NOTE 
pls use like a merge sort when adding new packets to the front end to make sure that sendms is ascending in order for accuracy sake
